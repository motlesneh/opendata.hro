    <h2>Production of the maps</h2>
    <p>The maps are generated by means of two different data sources: OpenStreetMap on the one hand (for waterbodies, roads and ways, railways, funiculars, aerialways, labelling) and the cadastral maps of uVGB-MV on the other hand (administrative boundaries, land use, buildings, house numbering). The data are kept in two independent databases that together are assembled into a collective whole for rendering the maps: these circumstances comply with the requirements of a collective database according to ODbL. The OpenStreetMap data are updated daily via automatic importing scripts whereas the uVGB-MV data are updated manually if required.</p>
